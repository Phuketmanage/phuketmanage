## Payment
The main principle is to be paid for closed tickets and for the standard workflow after training/learning, but not for the training/learning itself.

When approaching a task, you start by reviewing the ticket. If you have a general understanding how to solve the task, proceed and start the timer. If you don't understand it at first, study the question and begin working only when you feel prepared. Alternatively, if the ticket seems to big but you see that can complete a part of it, let us know, and we will break it down into smaller, more manageable tickets.
